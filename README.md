# PBTC eCommerce UI Project – Multi-Page (In Progress)

This is a **front-end multi-page UI project** inspired by the PBTC Christian eCommerce website, built from a Figma design.  
It currently includes three pages: landing, sign-in, and registration — with responsive layouts and interactive elements powered by vanilla JavaScript.

⚠️ **Work in progress:** Features and pages are actively being developed and improved.

---

## 🎨 Design & Concept

- **UI Design Source**: Figma (Designed by Tunde)  
- **Role**: Figma to Code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Client-side state persistence with `localStorage` (for simulating user login/registration)

---

## 📂 Project Structure & Pages

- `index.html` – Responsive landing page featuring product cards and interactive UI  
- `sign_in.html` – Sign-in page with form validation and simulated login functionality  
- `register.html` – Registration page with comprehensive validation and user signup simulation  

---

## 📁 Key Files

- `index.js` – Handles landing page UI interactions including:  
  - Sticky navbar with scroll effect  
  - Mobile hamburger menu toggle  
  - Product card slider with dot navigation  
- `main.js` – Controls sign-in and registration form functionality:  
  - Input validation for email formats and password matching  
  - Inline error messaging and success feedback  
  - Terms & conditions checkbox enforcement  
  - Password show/hide toggle icons  
  - Email registration tracking using `localStorage` to simulate backend persistence  
- `styles.css` – Shared stylesheet providing consistent styles across all pages

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- Expanding project with more pages (e.g., product details, cart, checkout)  
- Code modularization and optimization  
- UI animations and enhanced interactivity  
- Deployment for live demo access  
- Optional dark mode and accessibility improvements

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project helps me to:

- Build multi-page static websites with shared and page-specific JavaScript  
- Implement robust client-side form validation and user feedback mechanisms  
- Manage simple authentication-like state with browser storage (`localStorage`)  
- Apply responsive design and accessibility best practices  
- Write maintainable, clean front-end code based on real-world UI/UX needs

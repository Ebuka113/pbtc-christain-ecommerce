# PBTC eCommerce Landing Page (Clone)

This is a **front-end landing page clone project** based on a Figma design of the PBTC Christian eCommerce website.  
It was built for **practice purposes** and to showcase on my **portfolio** — this is **not a live site** and has **no affiliation** with PBTC.

While it's a static project with no backend integration, it includes **basic interactivity** such as a working mobile hamburger menu and a simple card slider.
